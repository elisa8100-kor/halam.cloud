      Hi, If you’re reading this, you sucseeded passing the test!<br />
      Thank you for that.<br />
      So the main reason I made this site is to ask you if you are healty and ask how you are doing well.<br />
      And Daniel i'm sorry that austraila got three ducks in the second batting in the ashes.<br />
      But, in 28 December 2025 Melbourne Stars got 1-132 I was stunned<br />
      I hope you will have a good day!<br />
      bye!<br />
      <br /><br />
      sincerely Halam
